# ThinGin
### Purpose
ThinGin (Thin rendering Engine) is intended to provide an efficient abstraction layer overtop the most common rendering APIs (Vulkan, DirectX, OpenGL).

### Refactor Status
The current system which exists on the main branch is merely a quick test implementation, its purpose was to explore what some of the requirements would be for the final system.
As such, ThinGin is undergoing a major rewrite to move to a much more elegant abstraction via an RHI (Render Hardware Interface) system.
This rewrite is happening over on the RHI_Refactor branch.
There is no ETA.

### Examples
The included example project showcases creating and rendering mesh objects.
The camera can be controlled to navigate and look around the scene.

##### Camera Controls
Movement = WASD / Spacebar   
Rotation = LeftClick & Drag   


### Usage
